 ## This is a fork of a project that me and my team (https://github.com/jfilm/zombie-time, https://github.com/Beidah) have created during the [Mintbean](https://tinyurl.com/yhbpr783) one week hackathon at August 2021.

# Zombie Time

Welcome to Zombie Time! This is a web browser-based game developed for a week long [Mintbean](https://tinyurl.com/yhbpr783) hackathon.

![screenshot](src/assets/images/landing/screenshot2.png)

Zombie Time was developed without any major frameworks, just vanilla JavaScript. The goal of the project was to see what kind of game we could build in a week without any kind of game engine to rely on.
